                            <h6><br>With an ideology that the root of innovation is ‘Interest’, the curriculum offers a wide range of elective courses
                                grouped into core and inter-disciplinary domains. At par with international engineering education, the students
                                can choose to study courses concerning areas of their interests.<br>
                                
                                KJ Somaiya Institute of Technology (KJSIT) provides quality education to engineering students. We motivate,
                                facilitate and guide our students by providing lifelong learning opportunities in a conducive learning
                                environment. The role of engineers for shaping the modern world is incredible. Hence the ultimate aim of any
                                distinguished technical education institute should be to promote a multifaceted development of the students.</h6>
